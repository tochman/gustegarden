# Application structure

I'll be using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) and following th guide.

Using Yarn: 

```
$ yarn create vite
```

I chose to use [SWC](https://swc.rs/) that claims to be much faster than Babel. 

Since I had an original folder named `gustegarden`, I had to move all files from the subfolder created by Vite to the root. 

```
$ mv gustegarden/* .
```
